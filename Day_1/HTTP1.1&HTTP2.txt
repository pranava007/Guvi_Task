HTTP/1.1: The Traditional Approach
HTTP/1.1 has been the predominant protocol powering the World Wide Web for over a decade. However, despite its widespread adoption, HTTP/1.1 has certain limitations that affect its performance, especially in the context of modern web applications and content-heavy websites. Here are some characteristics of HTTP/1.1:

Sequential Requests: In HTTP/1.1, each request from the client to the server establishes a separate TCP connection. This means that resources such as images, scripts, and stylesheets are fetched sequentially, leading to potential latency issues and slower page load times.

Header Redundancy: With each request, HTTP/1.1 sends redundant header information, even if multiple requests are made to the same server. This overhead increases the size of the data being transferred and contributes to slower performance.

Resource Bottleneck: The limitation on concurrent connections per domain in HTTP/1.1 (typically 6-8 connections) can lead to resource bottlenecks, especially when loading resources from multiple domains.

HTTP/2: A Leap Forward in Performance
In response to the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 was developed to offer significant improvements in efficiency and performance. Here's how HTTP/2 differs from its predecessor:

Multiplexing: One of the most significant advancements in HTTP/2 is multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel over a single TCP connection. This eliminates the need for multiple connections, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

Header Compression: HTTP/2 introduces header compression techniques, such as HPACK, to reduce redundant header information. This minimizes overhead and decreases the size of data transmitted between the client and the server, further improving performance.

Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces the concept of server push, enabling servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested. This can significantly reduce latency by eliminating round-trip delays for resource requests.

Binary Protocol: Unlike HTTP/1.1, which uses plaintext for communication, HTTP/2 employs a binary protocol, which is more efficient to parse and process. This streamlined approach enhances performance and reduces the complexity of implementations.
